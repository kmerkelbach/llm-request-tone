- **Casual/Neutral** – "Summarize this article."

## 2. Emotional Framing
Embedding an emotional state to influence the tone or empathy of the reply.

- **Positive Affect** – "I’m so excited to learn! Could you summarize the article?"
- **Negative Affect** – "I’ve been feeling down... Can you summarize it for me?"
- **Angry/Irritated** – "I’m sick of looking for this—just summarize it."
- **Playful/Humorous** – "Summarize it like you’re telling a bedtime story."

## 3. Persuasion & Manipulation Tactics
Trying to shape the response by appealing to motives, pressure, or self-image.
